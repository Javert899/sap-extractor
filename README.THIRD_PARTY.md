# SAPEXTRACTOR Third Party Dependencies

SAPEXTRACTOR depends on third party libraries to implement some
functionality. This document describes which libraries are depended
upon, and how. It is maintained by and for humans, and so while it is a
best effort attempt to describe the libraryâ€™s dependencies, it is subject
to change as libraries are added or removed.
